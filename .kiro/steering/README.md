@PM - Please create a project plan for a todo app
```

### Auto-Execute Workflow
Use the orchestrator for automated execution:
```
@ORCHESTRATOR --mode=full-auto
Build a todo app with React and Node.js
```

### Manual Role Switching
You can switch between roles as needed:
```
@SA - Review the architecture
@UIUX - Create wireframes
@DEV - Implement the login feature
```

## Workflow Phases

2. **Design** (@SA + @UIUX + @PO in parallel)
3. **Design Review** (@QA + @SECA in parallel)
4. **Development** (@DEV + @DEVOPS in parallel)
5. **Testing** (@TESTER)
6. **Reporting** (@REPORTER)

## Artifact Structure

All deliverables are organized in:
