# Knowledge Base - Project Memory

## Purpose
This knowledge base stores lessons learned, bug patterns, difficult features, and solutions that required multiple attempts. Use this as a reference when encountering similar issues in the future.

## 🔍 How to Use

### When to Create an Entry
Create a knowledge entry when:
- ✅ Bug required multiple attempts to fix (3+ attempts)
- ✅ Feature implementation was particularly challenging
- ✅ Solution was non-obvious or counter-intuitive
- ✅ Issue is likely to recur in similar projects
- ✅ Root cause analysis revealed important insights
- ✅ Performance issue required deep investigation
- ✅ Security vulnerability was discovered and fixed

### When to Search
Search the knowledge base when:
- 🔍 Encountering a new bug or error
- 🔍 Starting a complex feature implementation
- 🔍 Facing performance issues
- 🔍 Dealing with platform-specific problems
- 🔍 Making architecture decisions
- 🔍 Reviewing security concerns

### How to Search
1. **By Category:** Browse folders by type (bugs, features, etc.)
2. **By Severity:** Check critical/high priority entries first
3. **By Keywords:** Search for error messages, technology names, component names
4. **By Index:** Check `index.md` for quick reference

## 📝 Creating an Entry

### Step 1: Use the Template
Copy `.gemini/instructions/templates/Knowledge-Entry-Template.md`

### Step 2: Fill in Details
- Provide clear problem description
- Include code snippets
- Document root cause
- Explain solution step-by-step
- Add prevention measures

### Step 3: Choose Location
Place entry in appropriate folder:
- **Bugs:** `knowledge-base/bugs/[severity]/KB-[date]-[id].md`
- **Features:** `knowledge-base/features/[category]/KB-[date]-[id].md`
- **Architecture:** `knowledge-base/architecture/KB-[date]-[id].md`
- **Security:** `knowledge-base/security/KB-[date]-[id].md`
- **Performance:** `knowledge-base/performance/KB-[date]-[id].md`
- **Platform:** `knowledge-base/platform-specific/[platform]/KB-[date]-[id].md`

### Step 4: Update Index
Add entry to `index.md` with:
- ID, Title, Category, Tags, Date

## 📈 Metrics to Track

Track these metrics in `index.md`:
- Total entries by category
- Most referenced entries
- Average resolution time
- Recurrence rate

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Entries
1. **Be Specific:** Include exact error messages, versions, configurations
2. **Be Complete:** Document all attempts, not just the final solution
3. **Be Searchable:** Use clear keywords and tags
4. **Be Visual:** Include screenshots, diagrams, code snippets
5. **Be Preventive:** Focus on how to avoid the issue

### Using Entries
1. **Search First:** Always check knowledge base before starting
2. **Adapt Solutions:** Don't copy-paste blindly, understand the context
3. **Update Entries:** Add notes if you find better solutions
4. **Cross-Reference:** Link related entries together
