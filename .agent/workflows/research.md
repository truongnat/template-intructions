# Research Agent Workflow

## Purpose
**ALWAYS research before starting ANY task** to find existing knowledge, similar solutions, and avoid reinventing the wheel.

## When to Activate

### Automatic Triggers (MUST run before):
1. **Before Planning** (@PM starts) → Research similar projects
2. **Before Development** (@DEV starts) → Research similar features
3. **Before Bug Fixing** (@TESTER finds bug) → Research similar bugs
4. **Before Architecture** (@SA designs) → Research similar architectures
5. **Before Security Review** (@SECA reviews) → Research similar vulnerabilities

### Manual Activation:
- User types: `/research <task>`
- User mentions: "research", "explore", "find similar", "check knowledge base"
- Any role tags: @RESEARCH

## Research Process

### Step 1: Understand the Task
```markdown
**Task:** [Clear description]
**Type:** [general|bug|feature|architecture|security|performance]
**Keywords:** [Extract key terms]
```

### Step 2: Run Research Agent

```bash
# For general tasks
python bin/research_agent.py --task "Build authentication system"

# For bugs
python bin/research_agent.py --bug "Login fails with OAuth"

# For features
python bin/research_agent.py --feature "Real-time notifications"

# With specific type
python bin/research_agent.py --task "API design" --type architecture
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results

The agent will search:
1. **Knowledge Base** (File System)
   - `.agent/knowledge-base/bugs/`
   - `.agent/knowledge-base/features/`
   - `.agent/knowledge-base/architecture/`
   - `.agent/knowledge-base/security/`
   - `.agent/knowledge-base/performance/`

2. **Neo4j Knowledge Graph** (if configured)
   - Related knowledge entries
   - Technology patterns
   - Similar tasks
   - Solution patterns

3. **GitHub Issues** (if configured)
   - Related issues
   - Pull requests
   - Discussions

4. **MCP Tools** (if available)
   - Web search for best practices
   - Documentation lookup
   - Stack Overflow search

### Step 4: Review Research Report

Agent generates:
- `docs/research-reports/research-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` (detailed)
- `docs/research-reports/research-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` (summary)

**Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Research Report

**Task:** [Task description]
**Confidence:** [high|medium|low]
**Related Entries:** [count]

## Findings
- Found X entries in Knowledge Base
- Found Y entries in Neo4j
- Found Z GitHub issues
- Related technologies: [list]

## Recommendations
- ✓ Strong knowledge available - Review before starting
- ⚠️  Some knowledge available - Consider similar approaches
- ⚠️  Limited knowledge - Document thoroughly

## Detailed Results
[Links to relevant entries]
```

### Step 5: Make Decision

Based on confidence level:

#### High Confidence (5+ related entries)
```markdown
✓ **Strong knowledge available**

Action:
1. Review top 3-5 related entries
2. Extract successful patterns
3. Avoid known pitfalls
4. Reuse proven solutions
5. Update existing knowledge if needed

Proceed with: Informed implementation
```

#### Medium Confidence (2-4 related entries)
```markdown
⚠️  **Some knowledge available**

Action:
1. Review available entries
2. Identify gaps in knowledge
3. Consider similar approaches
4. Plan to document new learnings

Proceed with: Cautious implementation
```

#### Low Confidence (0-1 related entries)
```markdown
⚠️  **Limited knowledge - New territory**

Action:
1. This is likely a new challenge
2. Plan extra time for exploration
3. Document thoroughly for future
4. Consider prototyping first
5. Create detailed knowledge entry after

Proceed with: Exploratory implementation
```

## Integration with Roles

### @PM (Project Manager)

```

## MCP Integration

### Using MCP Tools for Research

```javascript
// Example: Search web for best practices
{
  "tool": "web_search",
  "query": "authentication best practices 2026"
}

// Example: Fetch documentation
{
  "tool": "fetch",
  "url": "https://docs.example.com/auth"
}

// Example: Query GitHub
{
  "tool": "github_search",
  "query": "authentication implementation",
  "repo": "user/repo"
}
```

### Research Agent with MCP

The research agent can be extended to use MCP tools:

```python
# In research_agent.py
def _search_web(self, task: str) -> Dict:
    """Search web using MCP"""
    # Call MCP web search tool
    pass

def _fetch_docs(self, url: str) -> Dict:
    """Fetch documentation using MCP"""
    # Call MCP fetch tool
    pass
```

## Output Format

### Console Output

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Research First
```markdown
❌ BAD: Start coding immediately
✓ GOOD: Research → Review → Plan → Code
```

### 2. Document New Findings
```markdown
If confidence is LOW:
→ This is new territory
→ Document thoroughly
→ Create KB entry after completion
```

### 3. Update Existing Knowledge
```markdown
If you find better solution:
→ Update existing KB entry
→ Add "Updated" section
→ Link to new implementation
```

### 4. Cross-Reference
```markdown
In your artifacts, reference research:

## Research Findings
- Reviewed KB-2025-12-15-001: OAuth Implementation
- Applied pattern from KB-2025-12-20-002: JWT Management
- Avoided issue from GitHub #123
```

## Troubleshooting

### Neo4j Not Available
```bash
⚠️  Neo4j driver not installed. Run: pip install neo4j
⚠️  Neo4j credentials not found in .env
```

**Solution:** Install driver or use file-based KB only

### GitHub API Rate Limit
```bash
⚠️  GitHub API error: Rate limit exceeded
```

**Solution:** Wait or use authenticated token

### No Results Found
```bash
✗ No entries found
```

**Action:** This is new territory - document thoroughly!

## Next Steps

After research:
1. **High Confidence** → Proceed with implementation, reference KB entries
2. **Medium Confidence** → Proceed cautiously, plan to document
3. **Low Confidence** → Plan extra time, prototype first, document thoroughly

**Always tag next role:**
```markdown
