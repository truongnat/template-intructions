## 🎯 Overview

This instruction set simulates a **complete Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** with specialized roles. When you invoke a role using `@tag`, the AI will act as that role and perform tasks according to the defined workflow.

**Supports all project types:**
- 🌐 Web Applications (SPA, SSR, PWA)
- 📱 Mobile Apps (iOS, Android, Cross-platform)
- 🖥️ Desktop Applications (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 🔌 Embedded Systems & IoT
- ⚙️ CLI Tools & Utilities
- 📚 Libraries & SDKs
- 🔗 APIs & Backend Services

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Execution Modes

The system supports 3 execution modes:

#### Mode 1: Manual (Default)
You tag each role manually at each step. Full control, step-by-step.

```
@PM - I want to build a wedding website...
[Review plan]
"Approved"
@SA - Begin backend design
[Review design]
@QA - Review design
...
```

#### Mode 2: Semi-Auto
Orchestrator auto-executes within phases, waits at phase boundaries.

```
@PM - I want to build a wedding website --mode=semi-auto
[Review plan]
"Approved"
→ Auto-executes: SA + UIUX + PO → QA + SecA
[Review design phase results]
@ORCHESTRATOR - Continue to development
→ Auto-executes: DEV + DevOps
...
```

#### Mode 3: Full-Auto (Recommended for Speed)
Orchestrator executes entire workflow, only stops at critical gates.

```
@PM - I want to build a wedding website --mode=full-auto
[Review plan]
"Approved"
→ Auto-executes entire workflow
→ Stops only at: Critical bugs, Final approval

[30-60 minutes later]
"⚠️ Decision required: 2 high-priority bugs found"
[Make decision]
→ Continues automatically
"✅ Project complete, ready for stakeholder review"
```

---

### Step 1: Start a Project

**Manual Mode:**
```
@PM - I want to build a wedding website with:
- Couple introduction page
- Countdown timer
- Photo gallery
- RSVP form
```

**Full-Auto Mode:**
```
@PM - I want to build a wedding website with:
- Couple introduction page
- Countdown timer
- Photo gallery
- RSVP form
--mode=full-auto
```

PM will create `Project-Plan-Sprint-1-v1.md` and wait for your approval.

### Step 2: Approval

After reviewing the plan, respond with:
- ✅ **"Approved"** - Proceed to next phase
- 🔄 **Provide feedback** - PM will revise and create a new version

### Step 3: Workflow Execution

**Manual Mode:** You tag each role as needed

**Semi-Auto/Full-Auto Mode:** Orchestrator handles the flow

```
Approved → Design (SA+UIUX+PO) → Review (QA+SecA) → Development (DEV+DevOps) 
→ Testing (TESTER) → Reporting (REPORTER) → Final Review (STAKEHOLDER)
```

## 🤖 Orchestrator Commands

### Check Status
```
@ORCHESTRATOR - Status
```

### Pause/Resume
```
@ORCHESTRATOR - Pause
@ORCHESTRATOR - Resume
```

### Change Mode
```
@ORCHESTRATOR - Switch to semi-auto mode
@ORCHESTRATOR - Switch to manual mode
```

### Skip to Phase (use with caution)
```
@ORCHESTRATOR - Skip to testing phase
```

## 🧠 Knowledge Base

### What is Knowledge Base?
A memory system that stores lessons learned, bug patterns, and difficult features for future reference.

### When to Use
**Create Entry When:**
- Bug required 3+ attempts to fix
- Feature was particularly challenging
- Solution was non-obvious
- Issue likely to recur

**Search Before:**
- Starting complex features
- Fixing unfamiliar bugs
- Making architecture decisions
- Dealing with platform-specific issues

### How to Use
1. **Search:** Check `.gemini/instructions/knowledge-base/index.md`
2. **Browse:** Navigate by category (bugs, features, architecture, etc.)
3. **Create:** Use `Knowledge-Entry-Template.md` when needed
4. **Update:** Keep index.md current

# Git & Task Management Workflow

**Requirement:** All tasks must be tracked with Jira-like precision and committed atomically.

## A. Task Board Logic
- All `Product-Backlog` items (User Stories) must be broken down into **Tasks** in the `Development-Log`.
- **Status Columns:** `Todo` | `In Progress` | `Review` | `Done`.
- **Assignal:** Every task must have an owner (e.g., `@DEV`, `@SA`).
- **Tracing:** Every completed task must link to a **Git Commit Hash**.

## B. Atomic Commit Rule
- ⚠️ **DO NOT** commit all changes at once at the end of a sprint.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Pick a task from `Development-Log` (Mark as `In Progress`)
  2. Implement the code
  3. Verify locally
  4. **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY:** `git commit -m "[Task-ID] <Description>"`
  5. Update `Development-Log` (Mark as `Done` and add Commit Hash)
- This ensures a clean, traceable history and prevents "big bang" integration issues.

## C. Definition of Done (DoD)
A feature/task is "Done" when ALL of the following are true:

### For Development Tasks:
- [ ] Code implemented according to approved design specs
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Local testing passed
- [ ] Evidence captured (screenshots/logs)
- [ ] Tagged with `#development`
- [ ] **Git Commit created and linked in Log**
- [ ] Handoff to TESTER completed

### For Testing:
- [ ] All test cases executed
- [ ] No critical/high bugs open
- [ ] Evidence documented in Test-Report
- [ ] Tagged with `#testing`

### For Deployment:
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing
- [ ] Staging environment verified
- [ ] Security checklist completed
- [ ] Tagged with `#deployed-staging` or `#deployed-production`

### For Project Completion:
- [ ] All Must-Have features verified
- [ ] STAKEHOLDER approved
- [ ] Final documentation complete
- [ ] User notified

## D. Automated Changelog Updates
- **Requirement:** Every commit MUST be followed by an update to CHANGELOG.md.
- **Format:**
  `markdown
  - [YYYY-MM-DD] [Commit-Hash] [Type]: [Description] (@Author)
  ``r
- **Types:** Feature, Fix, Refactor, Docs, Chore, Test.
