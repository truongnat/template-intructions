**Sprint:** sprint-2
**Branch:** `plan/sprint-2-requirements`
**Author:** @BA

## Epic 1: Strict Compliance Marketing
**Goal:** Highlight the new "Strict Execution Protocol" as a key differentiator.

### US-201: Strict Mode Section
**As a** CTO/Manager
**I want** to see how the system enforces compliance
**So that** I trust it with mission-critical projects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given the Features section
When I scroll to "Workflow Automation"
Then I should see a new card/section for "Strict Execution Protocol"
And it should mention "No skipping steps" and "Mandatory Communication"
```

## Epic 2: Visualizing the Ecosystem
**Goal:** Show the complexity of the 20+ workflows interacting.

### US-202: Ecosystem Diagram
**As a** Developer
**I want** to see a diagram of the roles and workflows
**So that** I understand how the "Brain" orchestrates them.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given the Brain Architecture section
When I view the diagram
Then I should see nodes for "20+ Workflows" and "Communication Protocol"
And they should be connected to the "Brain" node
```
