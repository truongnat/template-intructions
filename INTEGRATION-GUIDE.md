# Integration Guide - Add to Existing Projects

Complete guide to integrate TeamLifecycle SDLC into your existing projects.

---

## ✅ Yes, You Can Integrate!

TeamLifecycle works perfectly with existing projects. You can add it to:
- ✅ Existing codebases (any language/framework)
- ✅ Legacy projects
- ✅ Open source projects
- ✅ Team projects
- ✅ Monorepos
- ✅ Microservices

---

## 🚀 Quick Integration (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your-existing-project
```

### Step 2: Install Instructions

```bash
create-instructions install
```

**Output:**
```
🚀 Installing Template Instructions

→ Validating environment...
→ Checking for existing installation...
→ Copying template files...
✓ Installation complete!

Location: /path/to/your-project/.gemini

Next Steps:
  • Setup IDE: create-instructions ide cursor
  • Review: .gemini/instructions/usage.md
  • Start: /pm Build your project
```

### Step 3: Setup IDE

```bash
create-instructions ide cursor
# or
create-instructions ide all
```

**That's it!** You can now use `/pm`, `/dev`, `/auto` commands in your IDE.

## 🎯 Integration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Solo Developer - Existing Side Project

```bash
# You have a personal project
cd ~/projects/my-blog

# Add TeamLifecycle
create-instructions install
create-instructions ide cursor

# Start improving
# In IDE: /pm Review current architecture and suggest improvements

```

---

### Scenario 2: Team Project - Add to Existing Repo

```bash
# Clone team repo
git clone https://github.com/team/project.git
cd project

# Add TeamLifecycle
create-instructions install
create-instructions ide all
create-instructions init-kb

# Commit changes

```

---

### Scenario 3: Legacy Project - Modernization

```bash
# Old project needs refactoring
cd ~/old-projects/legacy-app

# Add TeamLifecycle
create-instructions install
create-instructions ide cursor
create-instructions init-kb

## 🔧 Advanced Integration

### Option 1: Selective Installation

```bash
# Install only what you need
cd your-project

# Install instructions
create-instructions install

# Setup only specific IDE
create-instructions ide cursor

# Skip knowledge base (add later if needed)
# create-instructions init-kb
```

---

### Option 2: Custom Configuration

```bash
# Install
create-instructions install

# Customize roles
nano .gemini/instructions/roles/dev.md

# Customize templates
nano .gemini/instructions/templates/Development-Log-Template.md

# Commit customizations
git add .gemini
git commit -m "Customize TeamLifecycle for our workflow"
```

---

### Option 3: Gradual Adoption

```bash
# Week 1: Install and learn
create-instructions install
create-instructions ide cursor
# Use for documentation only: /reporter, /pm

# Week 2: Add development
# Use for coding: /dev, /sa

# Week 3: Add testing
create-instructions init-kb
# Use for testing: /tester, /qa

# Week 4: Full workflow
# Use automation: /auto
```

---

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Tools

### Git Integration

```bash
# Add to .gitignore (if you want to keep instructions private)
echo ".gemini/" >> .gitignore
echo ".cursorrules" >> .gitignore

# Or commit (recommended for teams)
git add .gemini .cursorrules .github/copilot-instructions.md
git commit -m "Add TeamLifecycle SDLC"
```

## 🎓 Learning Path for Existing Projects

### Day 1: Installation & Exploration
```bash
cd your-project
create-instructions install
create-instructions ide cursor

# Explore
cat .gemini/instructions/usage.md
cat .gemini/instructions/global.md

# Try simple command
# In IDE: /pm Analyze current project structure
```

---

### Day 2: Documentation
```bash
# Generate documentation for existing code
# In IDE: /reporter Create documentation for current codebase
# In IDE: /sa Document current architecture
```

---

### Day 3: Code Review
```bash
# Review existing code
# In IDE: /qa Review code quality in src/
# In IDE: /seca Security audit of authentication module
```

---

### Day 4: Improvements
```bash
# Start making improvements
# In IDE: /dev Refactor user service
# In IDE: /tester Add unit tests for utils
```

---

### Day 5: Knowledge Base
```bash
create-instructions init-kb

# Document existing issues
# In IDE: /kb-add Solution for database connection pooling issue
# In IDE: /kb-add React state management pattern we use
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: .gemini Already Exists

```bash
# If you have existing .gemini folder
create-instructions install --force

# Or backup first
mv .gemini .gemini.backup
create-instructions install
```

---

### Issue 2: Conflicts with Existing IDE Config

```bash
# Backup existing config
cp .cursorrules .cursorrules.backup

# Install
create-instructions ide cursor --force

# Merge if needed
cat .cursorrules.backup >> .cursorrules
```

---

### Issue 3: Large Existing Codebase

```bash
# Install normally
create-instructions install

# Use gradually
# Start with documentation: /reporter, /pm
# Then add development: /dev
# Finally add testing: /tester

# Don't try to refactor everything at once
```

---

### Issue 4: Team Resistance

```bash
# Install for yourself first
create-instructions install
create-instructions ide cursor

# Show results to team
# Generate impressive documentation
# Demonstrate faster development

# Then roll out to team
git add .gemini
git commit -m "Add optional AI-powered SDLC tools"
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Private Projects

```bash
# Keep instructions private
echo ".gemini/" >> .gitignore
echo ".cursorrules" >> .gitignore
echo ".github/copilot-instructions.md" >> .gitignore

# Install locally only
create-instructions install
```

---

### Public Projects

```bash
# Safe to commit (no secrets)
git add .gemini .cursorrules .github/copilot-instructions.md
git commit -m "Add TeamLifecycle SDLC"

# Instructions contain no sensitive data
# Only workflow definitions and templates
```

---

### Sensitive Data

```bash
# Never commit sensitive data to knowledge base
# Add to .gitignore
echo ".gemini/instructions/knowledge-base/bugs/critical/*" >> .gitignore

# Or use separate private repo for knowledge base
```

---

## 📈 Measuring Success

### Before Integration
- Manual documentation
- Inconsistent code quality
- No structured workflow
- Knowledge in developers' heads

### After Integration (1 month)
- ✅ Automated documentation generation
- ✅ Consistent code reviews
- ✅ Structured SDLC workflow
- ✅ Knowledge base with 20+ entries
- ✅ 50% faster onboarding
- ✅ 30% fewer bugs

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
```bash
# Don't refactor everything at once
# Start with new features
# In IDE: /pm Plan new feature X
# In IDE: /dev Implement feature X
```

---

### 2. Document Existing Code
```bash
# Before making changes, document what exists
# In IDE: /sa Document current architecture
# In IDE: /reporter Create API documentation
```

---

### 3. Build Knowledge Base
```bash
create-instructions init-kb

# Document existing patterns
# In IDE: /kb-add Our authentication pattern
# In IDE: /kb-add Database migration strategy
```

---

### 4. Team Training
```bash
# Create team guide
# In IDE: /reporter Create onboarding guide for TeamLifecycle

# Share examples
# In IDE: /pm Example: How to add new feature
```

---

### 5. Gradual Rollout
```bash
# Week 1: You only
# Week 2: Your team
# Week 3: Other teams
# Week 4: Whole organization
```
